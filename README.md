# Lisper

![Rust](https://github.com/f0rget/lisper/workflows/Rust/badge.svg?branch=master)

Yes, one more lisp implementation based on
[Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com/) book.

## Mapping `C` book to `Rust`

- Introduction/Installation/Basics - [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- An Interactive Prompt - [rustyline](https://crates.io/crates/rustyline)
- Parsing - [pest](https://crates.io/crates/pest), there are other alternatives
such as [nom](https://crates.io/crates/nom), but pest seems more lightweight
- Error Handling - [burntsushi - 'Error Handling in
Rust'](https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/)
